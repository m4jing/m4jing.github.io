## About me

THIS is [*Jing Ma*](/), from China. I've been in Beijing for several years. I graduated from Beihang University (also known as BUAA, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)[^bh], majoring in Electronic Engineering and Information, and now I'm a graduate in Capital University of Physical Education and Sports (Beijing Institute for International Olympics Studies)[^cupes], researching sports and rehabilitation.

I know a little about computer science:

> 擅长 Word、Excel、PPT、Pages、Numbers、Keynote、XMind等软件的安装与卸载；
>
> 精通 data.frame、Matrix、ggplot2、Python、SPSS、MATLAB、OpenSim、Footscan等单词的拼写；
>
> 熟悉 Windows、Linux、macOS、Android、iOS等系统的开关机。

I'm fascinated by Data Science (for research and better life) and Running (an ancient but really attractive physical activity).

I love running because it makes me feel **inner peace**. When I was coaching people how to run better, with less running-related injuries, I feel a strong sense of achievement.

## Research interests

- Running biomechanics
  - Kinematics
  - Kinetics
  - Spatialtemporal parameters
- Running-related injuries (RRI)
- Sports rehabilitation
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Something I like

- **Data Science**: R[^r], Python[^py], etc..
- **Running**: I've completed 20+ marathons and trail races.
  - **Beijing Marathon**: The most frequent marathon I've ever taken part in, since 2014, which is my FIRST finished marathon race
  - **Shanghai Marathon**: It's always hard to get a bib number
  - **Hangzhou Marathon**: Only once
  - **Nanjing Marathon**: The beauty of Jiangnan is impressive
  - **Xiamen Marathon**: I've finished Xiamen Marathon 3 times in a row for 3 years, I must be crazy at that time
  - **QinHuangdao Marathon**: Met someone on the train from QinHuangdao back to Beijing after finishing the marathon race
  - **Hengshui Marathon**: I can still remember that the chip in my bib has broken, so I had no valid score, though I've finished it completely
  - **Guangzhou Marathon**: If you like hot weather, you should go there
  - **Chengdu Marathon**: Just a reminder, enjoy *Sichuan hot pots* after the race
  - **Wuxi Marathon**: A beautiful city
  - **Chongli Trail Race 50km**: Actually 57+ km due to the alteration of route halfway by the event committee
  - **JinShanling - The Great Wall Trail Race**: Got several awards from there
  - ...
- **Coaching**: I am a **certified running coach**, giving lectures, leading running groups, and coaching in marathon training camps. I also like 1-vs-1 teaching about running.
- **Table tennis**: Ping pong has grown bigger, so I need to learn how to play again. I was once a player in my school back in BUAA. I like *Xu Xin*'s elegant playing style, as well as *Ma Long*'s comprehensive skills and tactics.
- **Plank**: 4-point plank, with your body being a straight line. A good way to train your core; My personal best is about *40min*.
- **Music**: Xu Wei[^xw], is one of my favorite singers.
