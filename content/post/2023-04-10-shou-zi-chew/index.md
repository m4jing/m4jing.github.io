## 演讲文稿（中文翻译版）

大家好，我是周受资，很荣幸有这个机会和你们聊聊。

对于你和整个家庭来说，这是一个非常特殊的时刻。

我还清晰地记得16年前，我作为一名经济系学生从这里毕业。

今天我想花点时间和大家分享一下我一路走来学到的一些东西。

在新加坡这个小岛国长大，我知道我想要尽可能地去看看世界。

在伦敦和伦敦大学的学习生活，给了我多样化和国际化的经历。和你们中的大多数一样，在伦敦大学求学期间，我结交了一些来自世界各地的终身朋友。

毕业后，我不知道我想做什么，也不知道生活将把我带向何方。事后看来，并没有什么大计划。

我竭尽所能努力工作。当机会来临时，我抓住了它。

毕业后我的第一份工作是加入伦敦的一家投资银行——高盛。在那里我接触到了DST——一家刚起步的初创投资公司。

当时我没有任何投资经验，但我不断学习并强迫自己离开舒适区。

这期间，我遇到了很多互联网创始人，包括字节跳动和TikTok的创始团队。多年后，我担任了现在TikTok的职务。

在这个过程中的某个时候，我选择去美国读商学院。

我记得在做这个决定时很纠结，不知道这个决定是促进还是会耽搁我的职业生涯。

尽管我自己也不确定，但我还是很高兴自己做了这个决定，因为在那里我遇到了我的妻子。

我无法证明如果选另外一条路，我的职业生涯是否会更好，但我可以自信地说：正因为我当时的这个决定，我的生活更加充实、更有意义。

我想说的是：希望你们去拥抱即将开始的旅程。

生活会把你们带往许多方向。努力工作，充分利用你所拥有的，抓住随之而来的机会，但不要想得过多。

有时候当你被迫离开舒适区时，你会忐忑不安，这很正常。

在我看来，正是那些时刻给了我更多学习和发展的机会。

世界变化很快，总有你不熟悉的新情况发生。

无论你遇到什么，都要相信你习得的技能和知识会帮助你渡过难关。记住，你的教授会为你加油，你的朋友们和家人也会一直支持着你。

## Speech (English Version)

Hi, everyone. My name is Shou and I'm honoured to have the opportunity to speak with you today.

This is a very special moment for you and your entire family.

I still vividly remember sitting in your seats 16 years ago as a graduate of the Economics Department.

I want to take a few moments today to share a few things I've learned on my own journey.

Growing up in Singapore, a small island state, I knew that I wanted to see as much of the world as possible.

Being a UCL and living in London gave me a diverse and international experience. Like many of you, I made some amazing lifelong friends from around the world during my time at UCL.

After graduation, I didn't really know what I wanted to do or where life would take me. In hindsight, there was no big plan.

I worked hard with what I had. I put myself out there, and I took chances when they came.

My first job out of college was to join Goldman Sachs, an investment bank in London. There I was introduced to DST, a young investment firm that had only just started.

I didn't really have any investing experience then but I kept trying to learn and pushed myself to leave my comfort zone.

I met many internet founders during this journey, including the founding team of ByteDance and Tiktok, and many years later, I find myself taking my current role at Tiktok.

Somewhere in the middle of this journey, I chose to go to business school in the US.

I remember struggling with this decision, wondering if this decision would enhance or delay my career.

I'm glad that I did choose to go despite my own uncertainties, as it was there that I met my wife.

I would have no way to prove if my career would have been better if had taken another path, but I can confidently say that my life is fuller and more meaningful as a result of my decision.

The point I'm trying to make is to encourage you to embrace the journey you are going to embark on.

Life will take you in many directions. Work hard to make the most of what you have, take chances that will come your way, but don't overthink it.

Sometimes you will have to leave your comfort zone, and you will feel uncertain and uncomfortable. That's ok.

In my case, those were the times I found myself learning and developing the most.

The world is changing quickly, and there are always new situations that you're not going to be familiar with.

No matter what you encounter, have confidence that the skills and knowledge you've acquired will carry you through. And know that your professors will be cheering you on and friends and family will be supporting you along the way.
